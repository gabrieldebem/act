# Act

## WTF?
Act is a CLI to interact with [Toggl Track](https://toggl.com/track/).
I`m just tired to open the browser to start/stop the timer and i alread use the terminal for everything else.
Now i can start/stop the timer from the terminal and list all my tasks from yesterday to my daily report. 

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
